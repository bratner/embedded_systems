Course assignments for Embedded Systems Course

This repository includes all the work in progress for my embedded systems course.

The environment is the standard Microchip PIC32 processor and relevant tools by Microchip. 
Fortunately Microchip has its Mplab environment running on Linux ( Looks like a netbeans mod).

Will have to see if it is possible to use some generic linux tools instead and learn how to work 
with the ICE properly.
